## Functional Specification

This document should become the functional specification of the project you are working on.

A functional specification describes in great detail how a device or program will appear to an
outside user. That is, it treats all hardware as a "black box", the contents of which are completely
unknown to the user. The functional specification should include sections with the following information:

Your specification **should include** the following types of information:

* A title. Replace the title at the beginning of this document.
* Summary or introduction. In general, in a few lines or less, what is your program about or what is it about?
* How does the user access your program? Is it shared via http://runpython.com? Is a web site? Embedded in 
  a single board computer? 
* If there are graphics screens involved, describe every screen that the user will experience: what is it for? 
  What did the user have to do to get there and how does she move on to the next?
* For each graphics screen, describe every active control input and what it does. What elements on the screen will
  change in response to user input?
* Does the program respond to mouse input? What, exactly, does the mouse do?
* Does the program respond to keyboard input? How?
* What graphical assets will be used?
* Does the user have to do anything to install the program?

Your specification should **not** include the following types of information:

* The language you will use to create it.
* Names of any specific files in the project.
* How you will structure the classes, functions and code in your program.
